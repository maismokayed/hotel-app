Hotel Management & Reservation Platform

Hotel Management & Reservation Platform is a full-stack web application designed to serve both hotel administrators and guests.

The platform enables hotel owners and staff to manage hotels efficiently by handling rooms, availability, pricing, reservations, and users through a centralized admin dashboard.  
At the same time, it provides end users with a simple and intuitive interface to browse hotels, check availability, and make reservations online.

This project was developed as a college graduation project, focusing on real-world hotel operations, clean architecture, and secure API-based authentication.  
It demonstrates practical implementation of modern web technologies, role-based access control, and scalable system design suitable for real hotel booking platforms.
